# Talk: TDD for Frontend Developers

> How to write *good* tests

More and more people started to add tests to their SPAs.The field is still relatively new, and we all need more experience in how to test client-side applications most effectively.

With my talk, I show 1) how to come up with a solid testing strategy (tools and practices) and 2) work on a real-world example of how we combine E2E testing with component testing.

I want to highlight some general principles from testing theory and then go into the practical applicationâ€”live coding in a TDD manner.
